How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs will start with analyzing the system. This can be done by asking the team for feedback and asking earlier users for any errors or changes they should see within the code. Inputs and outputs should also be found.
  User stories can help gather this information because they are where users can express their needs and wants. Reading the user stories will help us understand the end user perspective.
