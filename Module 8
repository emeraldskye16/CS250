How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs will start with analyzing the system. This can be done by asking the team for feedback and asking earlier users for any errors or changes they should see within the code. Inputs and outputs should also be found.
  User stories can help gather this information because this is where users can express their needs and wants. Looking at the user stories will help us understand the end user perspective.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
	You can approach developing programs in several diverse ways. One strategy is the waterfall method, which helps in projecting the needs of a specific task. Another method is agile, which offers a more flexible strategy and is a unique way to work with testing, planning, and client interactions. These are not the only methods, but the ones focused on most within this class.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member could mean several different things, to many different people. To me, being a good team member means making sure you understand your part of the project, keeping up with your part, and not lagging, which will put the others on the team behind. It also means listening to your coworkers and helping anyone who may need it.
